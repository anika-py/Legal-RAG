**Live Demo:** [[https://avocado-ai.duckdns.org/](https://avocado-ai.duckdns.org/)]

## Overview
Avocado AI is an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to search through [Supreme Court of India judgments (1950â€“2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsingh0903/legal-dataset-sc-judgments-india-19502024) and provide context-aware answers. It allows users to query legal cases in natural language and get context-aware answers with references to judgments.  
Built with Flask, ChromaDB, Pinecone and Mistral, this project demonstrates my expertise in **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Full-Stack Deployment**.
